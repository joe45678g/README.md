### SQLProductsGT25: This is a list of products on an SQL, ordered in ascending order with prices greater than $25.
### SQLProductsByPrice: This file is to show an SQL, showing a list of products ordered based on their descending prices.
### NetworkDesign: I picked a topology for the infrastructure. I chose this because I wanted to create something that used both wired and wireless devices simultaneously. A switch is used to connect the wired devices in my lucidchart. A laptop is then wirelessly connected to a wireless access point. Here, the access point acts as a sort of link between the wired and wireless networks. I could have added more access points, but I decided to keep it simple and only show the topology of the infrastructure.
