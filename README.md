### SQLProductsGT25: This is a list of products on an SQL, ordered in ascending order with prices greater than $25.
### SQLProductsByPrice: This file is to show an SQL, showing a list of products ordered based on their descending prices.
### NetworkDesign: I chose an infrastructure topology. I chose this because I wanted to make something that used a combination of wired and wireless devices. Wired devices in my lucidchart are connected to a switch. A wireless access point is then connected to a laptop, wirelessly. The access point here works as almost a bridge between the wireless and wired networks. I could have put in more access points but I chose to make it the way I did to just show a basic infrastructure topology.
